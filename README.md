### Hey there, my name's Chelsea! 👋

#### About Me 🥰🎀
**My name is Chelsea.** I graduated from University of Washington with a B.Sc. Computer Science and Softfware Engineering, in July. My further curiosity in Computer Vision & Autopilot systems further led me to enroll in Georgia Tech's Masters of Science in Computer Science (ML & AI) part time program! 

**Current Projects.** One of the projects I'm working on now is an AI agent that can identify 192 visual/verbal from Rave's Progressive Mattrices. I've also been designing a Twitter Analytics Dashboard since it's my favorite social media app🙈
