### Hey there, my name's Chelsea! 👋

#### About Me 🥰🎀
**My name is Chelsea.** I recently graduated from University of Washington with a B.Sc. Computer Science and Softfware Engineering. Currently, I am enrolled in Georgia Tech's Masters of Science in Computer Science (ML & AI) part time program while working as a full time developer. Phew!

**I'm from the Borneo Islands!**. I have gained an appreciation for diversity and my insignificance in the grander scheme of things through my experiences.
