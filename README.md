### About Me ðŸ’Ÿ
***My name is Chelsea.*** I graduated from University of Washington with a B.Sc. Computer Science and Software Engineering, in July. My further curiosity in Computer Vision led me to join Georgia Tech's Masters of Science in Computer Science (ML & AI) part time program! 

***Mission Statement.*** I care about tech for social good, particularly in social justice and protecting the environment. As a Software Engineer, I want to use my skills to solve challenging research, design, and engineering problems that will contribute to society's betterment. 

***Current Projects.*** I'm working on an AI agent that can identify 192 visual patterns from Raven's Progressive Mattrices. I've also been designing a Twitter Analytics Dashboard with my sisters in my own time; Twitter is my favorite social media app of all time. ðŸ‘€

***My Life Philosophy.*** Results is the compound interest of 1) Consistent effort in a focused direction. 2) Constant incremental progress. 3) Long term gratification.
