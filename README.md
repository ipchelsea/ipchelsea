### About Me 🥰🎀
***My name is Chelsea.*** I graduated from University of Washington with a B.Sc. Computer Science and Softfware Engineering, in July. My further curiosity in Computer Vision  further led me to enroll in Georgia Tech's Masters of Science in Computer Science (ML & AI) part time program! 

***A book that I live by.*** Principles of Ray Dalio! 

***Current Projects.*** I'm working on an AI agent that can identify 192 visual patterns from Raven's Progressive Mattrices. I've also been designing a Twitter Analytics Dashboard with my sisters in my own time; Twitter is my favorite social media app of all time👀
