### Hey there, my name's Chelsea! 👋

#### About Me 🥰🎀
**My name is Chelsea.** I graduated from University of Washington with a B.Sc. Computer Science and Softfware Engineering, in June 2020. My further curiosity in Computer Vision & Autopilot systems further led me to enroll in Georgia Tech's Masters of Science in Computer Science (ML & AI) part time program!

**I'm from the Borneo Islands!**. I have gained an appreciation for diversity and my insignificance in the grander scheme of things through my experiences.
